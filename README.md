## Autonomous IoT-Based Railway Track Crack Detection Robot
Railway infrastructure safety is critical for preventing accidents and ensuring reliable transportation. This project presents an autonomous IoT-based robot designed to detect cracks and structural defects in railway tracks in real time, reducing the need for risky manual inspections.

The robot is equipped with IR and ultrasonic sensors to accurately identify track anomalies while moving along the railway line. An onboard camera captures images of detected defects, which are geo-tagged using GPS to pinpoint their exact location. Once a crack or irregularity is detected, the system instantly sends alerts and data to a cloud-based dashboard, enabling railway authorities to take proactive maintenance actions.

By combining automation, IoT connectivity, and real-time monitoring, this system enhances railway safety, minimizes human intervention, and supports efficient, data-driven maintenance of rail infrastructure.
