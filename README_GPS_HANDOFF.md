# GPS Handoff Guide

This document summarizes the GPS work already completed in this project and what still needs to be done next. It is written as a handoff for the person who will continue the ESP32 + GPS implementation.

## What has already been developed

### Firmware / ESP32 side
- The firmware now includes GPS support for the ESP32 pipeline.
- The publish payload was updated to include GPS-related fields such as:
  - `sensorId`
  - `crackDetected`
  - `severity`
  - `latitude`
  - `longitude`
  - `locationValid`
  - `satellites`
  - `timestamp`
- The payload is published to the MQTT topic `railway/cracks`.

### AWS / Lambda side
- The Lambda function `ProcessRailwayData` now accepts both:
  - the older test format with nested `location`
  - the newer flat GPS format
- The Lambda now writes GPS coordinates to DynamoDB successfully.
- DynamoDB updates are confirmed working after the Lambda fix.

### Web app side
- The React app has been updated so new alerts can be received through the live alert context.
- The live map was refactored to redraw when new alerts arrive, instead of only showing the first render.
- The app now supports showing fresh data from the stream without requiring a page refresh.

## Current working payload format

Use this format for the real GPS pipeline:

```json
{
  "sensorId": "ESP32-001",
  "crackDetected": true,
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "latitude": 6.9271,
  "longitude": 79.8612,
  "locationValid": true,
  "satellites": 7,
  "timestamp": "2026-04-19T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## What still needs to be done next

### On the ESP32 + GPS module side
- Wire the physical GPS module to the ESP32 board.
- Confirm the UART pins used by the GPS module.
- Verify GPS fix detection in real hardware.
- Make sure `locationValid` becomes `true` only when a valid fix is available.
- Confirm the published latitude and longitude values are real GPS values, not placeholders.
- Test MQTT publishing from the ESP32 directly to AWS IoT Core.

### On the AWS side
- Confirm the IoT rule is still enabled and subscribed to `railway/cracks`.
- Confirm the Lambda trigger continues to work with real ESP32 messages.
- Confirm DynamoDB stores the new real GPS values correctly.

### On the frontend side
- Confirm the live dashboard updates when a new crack event arrives.
- Confirm the Live Map shows the newest alert and robot position correctly.
- Confirm the alert card and map marker use the new GPS values.

## Testing checklist

1. Power on the ESP32 + GPS module.
2. Wait for a valid GPS fix.
3. Publish one crack event to `railway/cracks`.
4. Check CloudWatch for a Lambda invocation.
5. Check DynamoDB for a new item.
6. Check the frontend Live Map for the new alert marker.

## Notes for handoff

- The backend and Lambda paths are now functioning with test data.
- The remaining work is mostly hardware validation and real GPS integration.
- If the GPS module uses a different data shape, keep the Lambda parser aligned with the payload instead of changing the database schema unnecessarily.
